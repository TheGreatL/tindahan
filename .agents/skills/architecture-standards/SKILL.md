  agent is creating new files or folders to ensure consistency across the client and server.

# Architecture & Naming Standards Skill

## 🎯 Purpose

This skill ensures that the codebase remains clean, predictable, and scalable by strictly enforcing a feature-based
folder structure and uniform, lowercase file naming conventions.

## 🏗️ Core Responsibilities

- **Preserve Feature Isolation**: Ensure domains of logic (e.g., Auth, Orders, Products) remain self-contained.
- **Enforce Naming Rules**: Maintain a strict `lowercase-with-hyphens.purpose.extension` format for all files across the
  stack to prevent casing issues across different operating systems.

- [Server Architecture](../../server/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## 🛠️ Architecture Rules

### 1. Directory Structure (Feature-Based)

- **Feature Modules**: Both the `client` and `server` strictly follow a Feature-Based architecture.
  - ALWAYS place new domain logic inside `src/features/[feature-name]/`.
  - Do NOT dump domain-specific logic into global `src/components/`, `src/utils/`, or `src/controllers/` folders.
  - A feature folder should contain its own specific routing, state, components, or controller/service/repository logic.
- **Shared Utilities**: ONLY use `src/shared/` for code that is truly agnostic and used across _multiple_ features
  (e.g., global error handlers, UI primitives, generic API configuration).

### 2. File Naming Conventions

- **Strict Lowercase**: ALL file and directory names MUST be entirely lowercase. (e.g., `userComponent.tsx` is
  forbidden; use `user-component.tsx`).
- **No Spaces or Underscores**: If a filename contains multiple words, use a hyphen `-` separator (e.g.,
  `user-profile`).

#### Backend Files (Node/Express)

- Use standard dot-notation to explicitly state the file's purpose: `[feature/domain].[purpose].ts`.
- **Examples**:
  - `auth.controller.ts`
  - `auth.service.ts`
  - `auth.repository.ts`
  - `auth.route.ts`
  - `error.middleware.ts`

#### Frontend Files (React/Vite)

- **Logic / Hooks / Utils**: Follow the same dot-notation: `[domain].[purpose].ts` (e.g., `auth.store.ts`,
  `use-debounce.hook.ts`, `data-table.util.ts`).
- **React Components**: Use hyphenated `.tsx` or `.ts` files, generally ending with the element type if ambiguous. The
  purpose notation is optional here if the feature folder implies the component type.
- **Examples**:
  - `login-form.tsx`
  - `profile-card.tsx`
  - `dashboard.page.tsx` (if representing a full route layout)

#### 4. Naming Conventions for Types & Interfaces

- **T-Prefix Rule**: ALL types and interfaces MUST start with a capital `T` followed by an uppercase first letter.
  - **Correct**: `TJWTPayload`, `TAuthResponse`
  - **Incorrect**: `JWTPayload`, `AuthResponse`

#### 5. Strict Typing

- **No `any`**: The use of `any` is strictly forbidden.
  - Use specific interfaces, types, or `Record<string, unknown>`.
  - If a type is truly unknown, use `unknown` and perform type checking before access.
